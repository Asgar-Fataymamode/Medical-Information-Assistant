Thank you for reaching out regarding the patient's symptoms. Given that the patient is currently experiencing severe headaches, dizziness, and intermittent nausea, it is crucial that we schedule an appointment as soon as possible for a thorough evaluation. We need to address these alarming symptoms urgently.

Dr. Jane Smith has availability this week on the following days:
- Wednesday at 10:00 AM
- Thursday at 2:00 PM
- Friday at 1:30 PM

Please let me know which of these options works best for the patient, or if there is a need for alternative times. Additionally, please advise the patient to stay hydrated and rest as much as possible in the meantime. If symptoms worsen or become concerning, it may be appropriate to seek immediate care at an urgent care facility or emergency room. 

Looking forward to your prompt response so we can ensure the patient receives the necessary care. Thank you!
