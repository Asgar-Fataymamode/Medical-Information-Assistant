## Problem Statement
The healthcare sector faces several critical challenges:
1. **Shortage of healthcare workers** - Overwhelmed healthcare providers struggle
to attend to each patient effectively.
2. **Missed Medication Doses** - Patients often forget to take prescribed
medications on time, which can affect recovery and overall health.
3. **Limited Support for Post-Discharge Care** - Once discharged, patients may lack
adequate follow-up support.
4. **Inefficient Use of Healthcare Resources** - Healthcare providers often spend
valuable time on routine inquiries and basic cases. The sheer volume of these non-
urgent cases leads to delays in response times for patients requiring immediate,
critical attention.

## Agents and Communication

MIA’s functionality is powered by a multi-agent architecture, with four specialized
agents that work in tandem to deliver an efficient and responsive healthcare
experience. Each agent is designed to handle a distinct aspect of patient interaction,
managed under a central **General Manager Agent** to ensure seamless
coordination. Here’s how each agent contributes:
- **Report Summarizer Agent**: This agent uses natural language processing
algorithms to interpret and summarize complex medical reports into easy-to-
understand summaries for patients. It simplifies technical language, highlights key
insights, and addresses patient concerns by providing clear, concise information.
This allows patients to understand their medical data without needing constant
assistance from healthcare providers.
- **Appointment Scheduler Agent**: The Scheduler Agent automates the process of
managing patient appointments, streamlining the workflow for healthcare providers.
Integrated with MIA’s triage functionality, this agent prioritizes urgent cases by
dynamically adjusting appointment times based on symptom severity. Its goal is to
reduce wait times and ensure timely care, while freeing up healthcare providers from
administrative tasks.
- **WhatsApp Bot Agent**: Acting as MIA’s primary communication interface, this
agent handles all patient interactions on WhatsApp. It processes incoming
messages, directs them to the appropriate agent, and provides real-time responses
to patient inquiries. By leveraging WhatsApp’s platform, this agent makes MIA’s
services easily accessible, facilitating smooth and continuous engagement with
patients.
- **General Manager Agent**: As the central coordinator, the General Manager
Agent oversees the activities of the Report Summarizer, Appointment Scheduler, and
WhatsApp Bot agents. It ensures that each agent performs its role efficiently and
synchronizes their outputs to deliver a cohesive patient experience. This agent
handles task allocation, manages inter-agent communication, and maintains overall
operational flow, allowing MIA to respond quickly and accurately to patient needs.
Through this agent-based system, MIA combines advanced AI capabilities with
streamlined patient management, providing reliable support for patients and reducing
the workload on healthcare providers—all delivered seamlessly through WhatsApp.
### WhatsApp Integration
One of the core technical aspects of MIA is its seamless integration with WhatsApp,
enabling direct and continuous communication with patients. Through WhatsApp,
MIA acts as a proactive healthcare assistant, delivering key features such as:
- **Medication Reminders**: MIA sends reminders at scheduled intervals to ensure
that patients adhere to their prescribed medication regimen, reducing the risk of
missed doses and enhancing treatment effectiveness.
- **Health Check-ins**: MIA regularly checks in with patients to assess their overall
health. This includes monitoring for any potential side effects or allergic reactions to
prescribed medications, as well as checking for the emergence of new symptoms.

- **Symptom and Condition Monitoring**: MIA tracks patient responses to treatments
and alerts them if any symptoms or conditions indicate instability or a need for urgent
medical attention.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: If MIA detects a critical or worsening condition, it
facilitates the process of booking an appointment with the patient’s designated
doctor directly from WhatsApp. This streamlined workflow ensures patients can
quickly access the healthcare provider who originally diagnosed them, saving
valuable time in urgent situations.
